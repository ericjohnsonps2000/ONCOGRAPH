Overview
The graph models mechanistic interactions among genes, pathways, biomarkers, drugs, and diseases. Each node category is color-coded and connected through explicit semantic relations such as participates in, targets, associated with, and indicates [1].

Disease-Specific Contexts
Lung Cancer axis:
* Dominant oncogenes: EGFR, KRAS, ALK, BRAF, MET. [1]

* Tumor suppressors: TP53, STK11, KEAP1, RB1, SMARCA4. [1]

* Drug classes: EGFR-TKIs (Osimertinib, Gefitinib), ALK inhibitors (Crizotinib, Lorlatinib), checkpoint inhibitors (Pembrolizumab). [1]

* Key pathways: PI3K-AKT, RAS-MAPK, p53, PD-1/PD-L1. [1]

Breast Cancer axis:
   * Key genes: ERBB2, PIK3CA, BRCA1, BRCA2, ESR1, PTEN, CCND1. [1]

   * Drugs: Trastuzumab, Lapatinib, Tamoxifen, Olaparib. [1]

   * Pathways: ERBB2 PI3K-AKT, Homologous recombination repair, Cell cycle Cyclin D1–CDK4/6. [1]

Analytical Applications
      * Pathway enrichment: Track gene nodes participating in multiple oncogenic pathways. 

      * Therapeutic mapping: Identify drug–target–disease triplets for drug repurposing. 

      * Biomarker validation: Assess biomarkers associated with both lung and breast dysregulation. 

      * Fusion cluster tracing: Connect ALK, ROS1, and RET genes to drug-sensitive fusions.

Interpretation Framework
         1. Begin with a disease node. 

         2. Traverse associated with edges to extract active pathways. 

         3. From pathways, expand to participates in to find linked genes. 

         4. Map biomarkers and drugs associated via indicates and targets gene. 

         5. Use color codes for differentiation during visualization.
